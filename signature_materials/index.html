                    <h2>DFM FLUORIDES</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since 1992, LTS has been producing mil-spec compliant fluoride materials using the Direct Fluorination Method (DFM). LTS
                        produces the highest quality fluorides available in the industry: Our novel DFM process allows for the production of
                        extremely pure compounds with superior deposition properties.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Fluoride compounds produced via hydrofluoric acid (HF) reactions have impurities in the precipitated compound which are
                        not easy to purify out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Direct Fluoridation Method (DFM) is a specialized process defined by a high temperature plasma phase reaction of two
                        or three components to increase the purity, viscosity, and consistency of the material. Then, secondary melting in
                        fluorine gas atmosphere compensates for fluorine stoichiometry deficiencies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The process is costly, cumbersome, and occasionally non-deployable in the cases of scandium fluoride (ScF3), aluminum
                        fluoride (AlF3), cryolite (Na3AlF6), and a few other Rare Earth solutions of fluorides. LTS employs the DFM process in
                        its production of ultra-high purity fluorides such as LaF3, GdF3, NdF3, LiScF4, CaF2, and MgF2 production for DUV-NIR
                        applications, as well as YbF3, YF3, BaF2, CeF3, and our thorium fluoride (ThF4)replacement chemicals, solid solutions of
                        YBC fluorides for IR applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The process effectively removes contaminants as well as trapped gases. The result is a significantly purer material that
                        undergoes faster, cleaner deposition and ultimately provides a better optical coating.
                    </p>

                            YBC DFM is a highly preferred category of low-index materials transparent from the NIR to IR regions of the spectrum.
                            YBC DFM materials are recommended for multilayer coatings in AR applications in the 2,000-12,000 nm region, including
                            AR, bandpass, and dichroic filters. They are also suitable for laser coating applications.

                            In addition, YBC-905 cannot be used in high humidity environments or applications around the 3.8 and 5.6 micron range as

                            Scandium oxide is a high laser damage threshold optical coating material for use in UV laser applications at 337 nm and
                            248 nm. It has a LDT of >6 J/cm2 as well a moderately high index of refraction of ~1.8 at 550 nm. It is durable and has
                            good adhesion promotion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These properties make Sc2O3 a valuable antireflection / high-reflection and multilayer coatings material for ultraviolet

                            For this reason, LTS has developed scandates with similar or better optical properties that are cheaper and more
                            accessible to the medium budget user. These are based on compounding scandium oxide with other rare earth oxides to form
                            ternary compounds with less than half the scandium content but equivalent optical properties, including higher density
                            and refractive index.

                        <p>
                            Hafnium is a lustrous, silvery, ductile metal that resists corrosion by forming a tough, impermeable, oxide film on its
                            surface; it is unaffected by alkalis and acids, with the exception of hydrofluoric acid (HF). Hafnium exists in nature
                            in all minerals containing zirconium, but because of their similar properties, hafnium and zirconium are not easily
                            separated. The removal of hafnium begins with a liquid-liquid extraction process where one of the end products is
                            hafnium chloride. Pure hafnium metal is finally evolved when the hafnium chloride is reacted with a tetrahalide material
                            and magnesium at 1,100°C.

                        <p>
                            Hafnium is an excellent material for neutron absorption in control rods used in nuclear power plants; it is also used in
                            the recrystallization of tungsten filaments.

                            LTS offers high purity hafnium metal in a wide variety of sputtering target geometries and evaporation forms including
                            powder, pellets, and pieces. These materials are fabricated with electron beam melting - the hafnium metal is melted
                            layer by layer with an electron beam under a high vacuum. The employment of this technique allows for the manufacture of
                            hafnium products with exceptionally low quantities of intrinsic gases, a property highly sought after in the industry.

                            Hafnium oxide, HfO2, is a high-index, low-absorption material used for coatings in the near-UV (below 230 nm) to IR
                            (8,000 nm) regions of the spectrum. Films of hafnium oxide are combined with layers of silicon dioxide to form
                            index-contrasting multilayer structures with high damage thresholds at 350 nm. The material is supplied in compact form
                            as tablets and powders with few metallic impurities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            HfO2 is used in UV laser multilayer coatings, IR mirror coatings, emitter wire coatings, achromatic beam splitting, and
                            protective, polarizing, and dielectric coatings from the UV to medium IR region of spectrum (200-8,000 nm).

                            Ultra high purity HfO2, introduced by LTS, possesses unique characteristics: HfO2 (produced via LPF) shows absorption
                            below 224 nm and has a high packing density. Compared to other commercially available hafnium oxide products, our
                            hafnium oxide also exhibited the highest Laser Damage Threshold (LDT), therefore making it more useful for excimer
                            lasers applications. Our HfO2 is also completely outgassed and requires ⅓ less time in preconditioning for deposition.
                            LTS also manufactures chemically reduced versions of hafnium oxide conical inserts in various sizes for Telemark and
                            Temescal liners; we also produce these materials in evaporant forms such as pellets, pieces, and discs.

                    <p>
                        Semiconducting chalcogenide glasses, first produced in the late 1950’s, are normally classified as large covalently
                        bonded network solids that act as a single molecular complex. They exhibit some unique optical and electrical
                        properties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These properties make them promising candidates for modern technological applications. Specifically, ultrafast
                        broad-band response times, tunable third order nonlinear refractive indices, and optical band gap energy make these
                        materials useful for IR detectors, lenses, optical fibers, and photonic integrated circuits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chalcogenide glasses undergo thermally driven phase transitions, also giving them widespread use in rewritable CD and
                        DVD memory technologies. In addition to current storage technology, they are also used in emergent Phase-change Random
                        Access Memory (PRAM) development. An electric current pulse supplies the necessary heat to trigger the glassy-crystal
                        phase transformation from amorphous to crystalline. The read-out is performed by utilizing the relatively big
                        differences in electrical resistance of the two phases. The crystalline region may be transformed back to the glassy
                        state by a brief exposure to local heat followed by rapid cooling. These processes take only nanoseconds.

                        tetrahedral GeSe4 and pyramidal AsSe3 configurations, where the Se atoms can adequately bond to all of the Ge and As
                        atoms. Excess Se atoms form (Se-Se)n chains where n2 and 2 in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Group 3 glasses have Se
                            vacancies that are balanced by the formation of "defect" Ge-Ge and As-As bonds.

                            Of the thirty-two crystal classes twenty exhibit piezoelectricity (single crystal which don’t have a center of
                            symmetry). Ten of these represent the polar crystal classes, which show a spontaneous polarization without mechanical
                            stress due to a non-vanishing electric dipole moment associated with their unit cell. Those are pyroelectric. If the
                            dipole moment can be reversed by the application of an electric field, the material is said to be ferroelectric (FE).

                    <p>
                        As the world moves increasingly toward electricity based fuel, one important aspect is storage of that energy. Solar
                        cells can only generate power during daylight hours and electric cars need to bring the electricity with them. The need
                        for high performance batteries is higher than ever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lithium ion batteries satisfy these needs and LTS supplies Lithium XYZ Oxide cathode materials in coin cells as well as
                        our typical targets, powders, and shapeless pieces.

                    <p>
                        When evaluating battery materials, the factors of importance are Energy Density: the amount of energy stored per unit
                        weight or sometimes per volume. Specific Power: the speed you can deliver that energy. Lifespan: how many
                        charge-discharge cycles can the battery sustain before chemical changes render it too weak to function. Cost: self
                        explanatory. We should also consider Safety since lithium has a tendency to cause fires, Durability against high and low
                        temperatures and time, and Charge Rate.

                    <h2>PHOTOVOLTAIC THIN FILMS</h2>
                    <p>
                        The advent of photovoltaic technologies allows for direct conversion of solar energy to electricity. With the rise of
                        renewable energy technologies, photovoltaic systems are one of the solutions to meet the rising demand for energy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, amorphous and crystalline silicon wafers are the most extensively used solar cell systems. However, novel
                        thin film technologies are being developed to replace existing silicon systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In thin-film solar cells, layers of semiconducting materials are applied to a solid substrate. When compared to silicon
                        wafers, these thin films require less material, and therefore substantially diminish production costs.

                    <h2>TRANSPARENT CONDUCTIVE OXIDES</h2>
                    <p>
                        Transparent conductive oxides (TCO's) are electrically conductive materials with a low
                        absorption of electromagnetic waves within the visible region of the spectrum. They are used in
                        a variety of applications such as flat panel displays, thin film solar cells, light emitting
                        diodes (LEDs), opto-electrical interfaces, touch screens, and automobile window de-icers and
                        de-foggers. Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is the most widely used transparent conductive oxide
                        material; it has exceptional properties such as low resistivity (~10-4 Ω-cm) and high
                        transparency in the visible spectrum. However, ITO is an expensive material. For this reason,
                        Aluminum-doped Zinc Oxide (AZO) and Indium-doped Cadmium Oxide have been utilized as alternative
                        materials.

                    <h2>THERMAL SPRAY POWDERS</h2>
                    <p>
                        Thermal spraying is an industrial coating process that consists of using a heat source (flame or otherwise) and a
                        coating material in powder or wire form, which is melted into tiny droplets and sprayed onto surfaces at high velocity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thermal spray coatings can be utilized to protect workpieces from severe corrosion, high temperatures, chemicals,
                        environmental abrasion, and other hazards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They are also used to impart electrical insulation or conductivity, oxidation resistance, and a number of other
                        performance improvements.
