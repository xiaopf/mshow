                    <h2>MANUFACTURING</h2>
                    <p>
                       In addition to our standard catalog of high quality materials, LTS has been designing,
                       synthesizing, and manufacturing custom material formulations since 1999. Our innovative
                       production methods, coupled with our integrated manufacturing and finishing facilities, allow us
                       to control product parameters to a high degree of precision.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       We produce our materials in a variety of forms - including pieces/granules, powder, sputter
                       targets, and custom designs - to fit your deposition parameters. The purity of our compounds is
                       carefully controlled and many are available in 99.999% or higher.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       To handle the difficulties faced in synthesizing unstable chemical formulations, LTS's factories
                       are equipped for numerous processing methods. Common materials are produced via Hot Press. Higher
                       densities can be achieved through various Vacuum Melting techniques. For materials that generate
                       a natural undesired polarization, the material is melted then powdered to homogenize it and
                       pressed into final shape. We can vary production protocols to meet any challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       For custom designed targets and other pieces, we have a machine shop with precision tools to cut
                       holes and edges. We also supply Backing Plates for our targets per specification. Backing plates
                       provide stability and extend the lifetime of a sputtering target. To secure the target to the
                       backing plate, we bond them together with appropriate agents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       Over the years, LTS has collaborated with several companies to research and develop new products
                       that have since proven to directly compete with existing materials, or have entirely replaced
                       them as industry standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       LTS also works with clients to:

                                    is employed. These are the very highest purity materials, as the mechanical powder
                                    formation process often introduces trace impurities.

                                    DC/RF sputtering deposition is a popular process that uses targets typically shaped
                                    as large homogeneous discs. We produce targets from 1" diameter up to as large as
                                    18" diameter as well as multi-tile planar and special style targets like delta and
                                    ConMag.

                            Sol-Gel process: In materials science, the solâgel process is a method for producing solid materials
                            from small molecules. The method is used for the fabrication of metal oxides, especially the oxides
                            of silicon (Si) and titanium (Ti). The process involves conversion of monomers into a colloidal
                            solution (sol) that acts as the precursor for an integrated network (or gel) of either discrete
                            particles or network polymers. Typical precursors are metal alkoxides.

                            each, if the material is deemed unacceptable by the customer, LTS will refine the process based on
                            analysis of the previous attempt and try again

                    <p>
                        LTS manufactures custom backing plates to suit your specific sputtering processes. The selection of an appropriate
                        backing plate is critical as it is used to mount the target in the sputtering system. We offer backing plate materials
                        such as oxygen-free, high conductivity copper (OFHC), copper chromium, copper zirconium, aluminum alloys, and stainless
                        steel in various shapes sizes and geometries.

                        We also provide bonding services to adhere the sputtering targets to the backing plates. Indium and Silver-Epoxy bonding
                        agents are chosen provide high electrical and thermal conductivity, channelling heat and charge build-up away from the
                        target. They also protect the target-backing plate interface from diffusion and alleviate stress cause by differing
                        thermal expansion at the interface by thermal creep.
